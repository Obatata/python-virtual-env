##### current PYTHONPATH
#Linux
echo $PYTHONPATH # display current PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD" # si nous voulons un PYTHONPATH

# Windows
Got to the Windows menu, right-click on “Computer” and select “Properties”:
From the computer properties dialog, select “Advanced system settings” on the left:
From the advanced system settings dialog, choose the “Environment variables” button:
In the Environment variables dialog, click the “New” button in the top half of the dialog, to make a new user variable:
Give the variable name as PYTHONPATH and the value is the path to the code directory. Choose OK and OK again to save this variable.
Now open a cmd Window (Windows key, then type cmd and press Return). Type:

echo %PYTHONPATH%

to confirm the environment variable is correctly set.
If you want your IPython sessions to see this new PYTHONPATH variable, you’ll have to restart your terminal and restart IPython so that it picks up PYTHONPATH from the environment settings.


#Python
>>> import os
>>> os.environ['PYTHONPATH']
